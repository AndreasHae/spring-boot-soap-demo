# Spring Boot SOAP service demo

This project serves as an example of how to implement a simple SOAP service using Spring Boot. It roughly follows the [official Spring guide](https://spring.io/guides/gs/producing-web-service/) on web services.

The service also has a corresponding mobile client application implemented with Flutter which can be found [here](https://github.com/AndreasHae/flutter-soap-demo).

The project originated from a networking assignment which consisted of writing a backend service and Android client application using the SOAP protocol.
